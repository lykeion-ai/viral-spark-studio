Most of your audience isn’t ready to buy.

And that’s the biggest marketing mistake brands make.

They focus only on the people ready to convert right now.

The real game? 

Building brand before the purchase moment happens.

Because when the buyer finally feels the pain, does the research, or gets the budget…

They’ll buy from the brand they already trust.

That’s why marketing isn’t just about demand capture. It’s about demand creation.

Stay top of mind. Stay relevant. Stay in their world.

So when they’re ready… they come straight to you.
