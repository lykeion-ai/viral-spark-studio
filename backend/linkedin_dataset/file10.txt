Hate email marketing? 

I don't blame you.

It's old. 
It's boring. 
It's difficult.

But none of that matters.
Because it works.

For startups, big brands, and solopreneurs.

You'll never regret investing in it. 

Why?

1. Ownership: You own your list. 
2. Control: No algorithms. No instability. No bans.
3. Conversion: It converts better than other channels.

That least point alone wins this argument.

You need an email list.

Here's how to get one:

1. Create a freebie your audience will love.
2. Build a sign-up form for your email list.
3. Promote the freebie on the form.
4. Share the form everywhere

Your goal?

Turn rented followers (social media followers) 
Into owned followers (email subscribers)

Don't wait.
Build your list.
