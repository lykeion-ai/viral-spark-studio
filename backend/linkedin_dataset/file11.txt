My No.1 goal on LinkedIn this year? 

Upset more people. 

Don’t worry, I’m not going to go on a Kanye-style Twitter rant. 

However, more people need to realise that LinkedIn isn’t about pleasing everyone. 

Because when people don’t like your opinions or content… 
↳ This is a good thing! 

Because all you’re doing is pushing away the people that don’t align with you. 
⬇️ 
And attracting the people who do align with you. 

So if you’re trying to grow your personal brand 
↳ Don’t stress pleasing everyone! 

Because you’ll only end up with an audience that doesn’t align with who you really are. 

So this year, I’m not focusing on pleasing anyone. 

I’m going to be myself & build an audience that aligns with me. 

Because that’s how you build a great personal brand & community.
