Content is dead. It's always been dead. It's a meaningless word used to describe marketing communication output that can better be described as 'stuff'. 

The Beatles, Hilary Mantel and Michaela Cole weren't making content. They were making music, writing books and screenplays. 

And none of their listeners, readers or viewers ever said "That was some bloody good content. I really enjoyed that."

Guess who also never says that? Your target audience. The only people who say 'that was good content' is marketers talking about other marketers stuff. 

Your target audience will tell you they enjoyed reading the latest research piece of watching that tour of the factory floor. The word content will never be uttered.
