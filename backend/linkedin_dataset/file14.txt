So this year, I hosted 15 offline risingnow events for over 400 people - and honestly, these 6 tools made it so much easier (and one that failed to do so 🙃). If you’re planning events, these will definitely make the process more fun 👇🏼

1. Notion + AI 
This became the digital HQ for all my projects. Tasks, notes, and plans – everything in one place, and super easy to collaborate with the team. The AI feature was a huge time-saver for brainstorming ideas, writing event descriptions, and polishing up email campaigns.

2. Loops 
I know Loops is mostly for SaaS companies, but turns out it’s perfect for events too. Free for up to 1k contacts, great when I was just starting to build the email list. It’s way easier to use than Intuit Mailchimp, especially for customizing emails.

3. Luma 
Kept all event details together, handled RSVPs, and managed ticketing in one place. I liked how simple it was, but there was still enough room to play around with the designs. 

4. Figma 
Even though it’s not specifically for event planning, it’s perfect for making flyers and social media graphics. It’s also super collaborative, so the team could hop in and update designs in real time.

5. Instagram 
Good old IG! Reels + a few targeted ads = people who actually wanted to come to the events. It felt like the easiest way to reach the right audience and grow the wellness community.

6. Midjourney 
I used MidJourney to create abstract visual assets for promo materials and event branding. 

These tools definitely made the whole thing smoother - hope they’re helpful for you too!
