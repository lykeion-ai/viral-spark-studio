Friday's Tim Tam Tip: is your brand stuck like chewy caramel? Chewy Caramel Tim Tams are delicious, but let’s be real; they stick to your teeth like they’re never letting go.

Your brand can do the same thing… but in a good way.

A strong brand sticks in the minds of your audience. But here’s the thing, brands aren’t set-and-forget. They grow, evolve, and need refining to stay relevant.

That’s exactly why we are working on updating The LinkedIn Branding Book. 

LinkedIn has changed. I’ve been through Operation Rebrand, and I want it polished before I hit the road for my P.A.G.E. Advocacy international speaking tour. 

If you haven’t revisited your brand in a while, it might be stuck in the past instead of sticking with your audience.

When did you last refine your brand and give your LinkedIn Profile some love? 

Happy Friday 😀
