Controversy is 🤴

Let me tell you what I mean-

As a personal branding agency, we understand how important it is for founders to reach a large set of their target audience.

Currently, we are working with some of the top founders globally and to them, their reputation matters the most and of course for all the right reasons.

Whenever we ask our clients to post controversial content, they are always reluctant, and of course, putting out even a little bit of wrong content from their profile can do more harm than good.

But let me tell you what we tell them-

Controversy doesn’t always have to be negative; it can just be an unpopular opinion that people have on certain things.

For example - I did a post on how working on vacations is fine. It got me 500k+ impressions in a month and my DMs flooded.

Was it something negative? No
It was just an unpopular opinion that a lot of people don’t agree with and a lot of people who agree stopped because they can finally see someone talk about it in public.

Both of which are fine.

As a human, you are not bound to agree to everything and till the time you are not being negative or hurtful to anyone, it’s absolutely fine to put your opinion forward.

And trust me, most successful founders have many beliefs that probably do not align with those of most people.
