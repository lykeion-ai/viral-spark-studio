Here's some harsh truth for agency LinkedIn creators:

→ You can have great storytelling.
→ You can have a unique personal brand.
→ You can have an “authentic voice.”

But if you don’t:

→ Understand what your audience actually wants
→ Build an email list so LinkedIn isn’t your only channel
→ Nail formatting and hooks so people actually stop scrolling

Then you’re just posting for likes, not ROI.

Yeah, it's sad.

LinkedIn’s algorithm is bland and repetitive. It wants the same kind of content over and over. 

The challenge is injecting just enough personality so you don’t feel like a robot while still playing by its rules.

The more I leaned into this and treated LinkedIn as a performance channel, the more my agency grew.
