How long should your LinkedIn posts be?

I analyzed the latest 100 posts from high-performing creators to find the sweet spot.

𝗧𝗟;𝗗𝗥: The optimal length for LinkedIn posts averages around 240 words, particularly for image + text formats.

But there's more to consider.

Let's break down what I discovered:
