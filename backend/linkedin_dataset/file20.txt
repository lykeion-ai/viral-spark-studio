If you are questioning investing in coaching.....

You are not my audience

At this point in my career I really don't need to:

→ Justify what I do
→ Justify how much I charge
→ Convince anyone of anything 

At this point in your career you shouldn't be asking:

"Why should I invest in coaching?"

At this point in your career you should be asking:

"Which coach is the right one for me?"

Think about this one for a second:

→ Does an athlete question having a trainer?
→ Does a CEO question having advisors?
→ Do leaders question having mentors?

I want to talk to people who already understand:

→ What support means
→ The power of a great program
→ Why investing in themselves is critical 

Oh and just in case you DO want to know what I charge?

I used to only have one option for $5K a month.

Now? You can get into my 90-Day Framework for $49 a month. 

There are no secrets here. Just results....if you do the work.
