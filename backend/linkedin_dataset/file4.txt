How I increased my average order value by 41% on a low ticket checkout page:

Been toying with upsells recently and it’s been fun.

I previously had a little funnel that was getting 
pretty decent passive income 
considering it was all organic. 

(Approx $100-150 per day selling a $47 (front end) product. For context my audience on LinkedIn is 45k, and I get about 4-5k profile visits a month, and have never ran a single ad).

My core offer was primarily mentorship. 

Then I bolted on digital products as I was 
building things out & repackaging them.

2 upsells that worked well:

1. Pre-selected supplementary product 

Mention nothing about the 2nd product until you hit the checkout page.

Default select the 2nd product. User has to uncheck to not purchase.

Got 41% in upsells. So averaging $147 in AOV from the original $47.

2. Trip wire inside the offer 

Add a “what’s next?” section inside the product.

Then pitch the next thing they’d want to do after they’re done.

I used to pitch the higher ticket service but adding a product that’s in a similar price range resulted in 27% upsells from once off customers, now becoming repeat customers.

It’s nothing new, but it’s fun to witness it.

High ticket is incredible. 

But the feeling of low ticket without 
the need for delivery is unmatched.
