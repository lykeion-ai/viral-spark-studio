We recently created a new LinkedIn DM strategy.

In January, it booked ~80 sales calls.

Here’s how it looks in 4 steps:

1️⃣ Opener + qualification

In 1 message, we can:

a. Build rapport 
b. Qualify prospects 

For example:

“Hey John - massive fan of your recent post. I completely agree. How’s LinkedIn lead-gen going for you - you winning?”

Here’s a template you can use:

“Hey [name] - [specific compliment]. How’s [achieving thing] going for you - [ask if it’s working]?”

(I’ve got a few opener messages that work well, but this is one of my favs)

2️⃣ The reply

This can go 2 ways…

1.  IF they say ‘no, I’m not winning’ (i.e. ”I could do better…”)

↳ “OK, I wonder if I could help you solve that. Worth us jumping on a call to see if I can help?”

2. BUT if they say ‘yes, I am winning’, move onto step 3 👇

3️⃣ Create the gap 🫸      🫷

They’ve told us that what they’re doing is currently working (i.e. “I’m doing well enough.”)

But when I was making $10K a month, I thought I was doing good. A coach showed me I could do better (that’s how I hit $50k a month).

Because the change from a current state → a goal = is a skill gap (and we’re here to fill it).

SO… we ask something like:

↳ “I’m glad your efforts are paying off :) What does step 2 look like for you (what’s your next goal…)?”

No matter what they respond with, you can move onto step 4 👇

4️⃣ Close the gap 🤏

They’ve established they want to get somewhere that they’re currently not.

So it’s safe to say they could use some help getting there…

So I respond: 

“Love the ambition! I wonder if I can help you get there quicker. Worth us jumping on a call to see if I can help?”

It’s as simple as that…
