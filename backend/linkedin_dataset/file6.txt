*I just crossed 50k followers on TikTok. It happened overnight!*

*After 3 years of posting 5-10x a week, refining my content, listening to my audience, pivoting my ICP, creating some really low-engagement posts and not getting discouraged, resisting the temptation of hopping on trends, getting spammed by fake accounts, being bullied by a few people, and damn-near quitting after the first year.

So yeah, overnight success.
