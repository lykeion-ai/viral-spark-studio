We recently created a new LinkedIn DM strategy.

In January, it booked ~80 sales calls.

Here’s how it looks in 4 steps:

1️⃣ Opener + qualification

In 1 message, we can:

a. Build rapport 
b. Qualify prospects 

For example:

“Hey John - massive fan of your recent post. I completely agree. How’s LinkedIn lead-gen going for you - you winning?”

Here’s a template you can use:

“Hey [name] - [specific compliment]. How’s [achieving thing] going for you - [ask if it’s working]?”

(I’ve got a few opener messages that work well, but this is one of my favs)
