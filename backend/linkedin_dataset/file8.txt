Alex Lazarow in Entrepreneur magazine describes it well:

“Camels adapt to multiple climates.

Camels survive without food or water for months.

When the time is right, they can sprint rapidly for sustained periods of time.

Unlike unicorns, camels are not imaginary creatures living in fictitious lands.

They are real, resilient and can survive in the harshest places on Earth.

While the metaphor may not be as flashy, these startup camels prioritize sustainability, and thus survival, from the get-go by balancing strong growth and cash flow.”
