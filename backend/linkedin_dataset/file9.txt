I think Mr. Beast is onto something with this advice. I also heard Dan Briscoe preach a similar idea so I’m going to ask my network for some consultant recommendations. I’m looking for: 

1) A YouTube Growth Consultant w/ experience growing channels that go after a business audience. Someone who doesn’t just understand the importance of the thumbnail but can give guidance on how to build a YouTube engine at scale. 

2) An experienced Agency Growth / Leadership Consultant who has helped service companies scale beyond $10M and achieve great profitability. Looking for both CRO-esque experience (built and oversaw sales teams) + CEO experience (scaled the team w/ success). 

3) A consultant with experience in M&A for SaaS.

4) Consultants with experience scaling AI Martech Software — I’d love to chat with those who have been in the trenches and had an exit or have grown their business to reach significant scale. 

Give me all the recos!
